# IT System Report Tool
This program uses Python to fetch a computer system's vital information and automatically generate a report in either .txt or .csv format for quick data analysis.

## How It Works
Using Python and psutil, platform, socket, subprocess, os, and datetime libraries, this tool quickly logs a system's information, runs an internet ping test, logs the results and reports the top 5 current processes that use the most memory.
Each system report generated is automatically named with the time and date the report was generated for easy data tracking. This is all then wrapped within a simple GUI made with the tkinter library.
